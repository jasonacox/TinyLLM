# TinyLLM Chatbot Releases

## Container

The TinyLLM Chatbot docker container is available at: [jasonacox/chatbot](https://hub.docker.com/r/jasonacox/chatbot).

## 0.16.4 - Document Generation Support

* Added comprehensive document generation functionality with support for PDF, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint formats.
* Added intelligent document intent detection that automatically recognizes when users request document creation.
* Added document download functionality with direct browser download links for generated documents.
* Added dedicated document generation module with structured content processing and LLM-enhanced formatting.
* Added support for conversation context in document generation, allowing users to create documents from previous responses.
* Fixed route mounting order to ensure document download routes are properly accessible.
* Enhanced frontend to display download links with document icons for generated files.
* Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the document generation pipeline for better troubleshooting.

## 0.16.3 - OpenAI Image Generation Support

* Added OpenAI DALL-E image generation support with dedicated environment variables.
* Added separate configuration for OpenAI image generation: `OPENAI_IMAGE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_IMAGE_API_BASE`, `OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL`, and `OPENAI_IMAGE_SIZE`.
* Fixed "/image route not enabled" error by separating OpenAI image settings from LiteLLM proxy configuration.
* Improved image generation route handling with automatic format detection for different providers (SwarmUI/OpenAI).

## 0.16.2 - Repetition Filter Settings

* Added environment variables for repetition filter: `REPEAT_WINDOW` and `REPEAT_COUNT`.
* These control the window size and repeat count for the LLM output repetition filter. Users can now adjust these via environment variables to fine-tune anti-repetition behavior.
* Documentation: Updated Chatbot environment variable sections in the README to use consistent tables.
* Documentation: Improved clarity, formatting, and consistency in README and environment variable documentation.

## 0.16.1 - Image Generation

* Added environment variables for image generation settings: `IMAGE_MODEL`, `IMAGE_CFGSCALE`, `IMAGE_STEPS`, `IMAGE_SEED`, `IMAGE_TIMEOUT`, `IMAGE_WIDTH`, and `IMAGE_HEIGHT`.

## 0.16.0 - Refactor Chatbot

* Refactor - To improve maintainability and prepare for future expansions, the chatbot code has been modularized.
* Image Generation - The chatbot now uses the SwarmUI APIs to generate images. Users can request image generation using the explicit `/image {prompt}` command or indirectly by using the intent router. Intent router will allow for user dialogue to adjust the image via prompt updates.
* Upgrade note: This is a major version upgrade. You will need to reset your prompts for the image intent to work correctly.

## 0.15.25 - Improvements

* Chatbot - Improve intent routing for news.

## 0.15.24 - Intent Improvements

* Chatbot - Improve the conversation context for intent routing. This allows conversational intent following.

## 0.15.23 - Intent Hotfix

* Chatbot - Fix intent router to work with multi-modal (image) context. Updated internet search RAG to better handle conversation thread context answering.

## 0.15.22 - Intent Router

* Chatbot - The chatbot now has simple heuristics (based on LLM queries) to determine the users intent and to route to the built-in functions to ground the response. This includes internet search functions `/news`, `/stock`, `/weather` and `/search`.
* To activate set environmental variable `INTENT_ROUTER=true` or use the prompt command `/intent on`.

## 0.15.21 - Internet Search

* Chatbot - The `/search` command has been added to allow the chatbot to search the internet to help answer your prompt. By default, the first 5 most relevant internet search results are added to the context.

Usage: /search {opt:number} {query}

## 0.15.20 - Chatbot Model

* Model selection behavior improved. Session will persist with selected model in that session even when refreshed. Last model selection will be remembered and auto-selected for any new sessions but will not impact existing sessions.

## 0.15.19 - Chatbot Docs

* Update URL reader to display reading status to user while processing document.

## 0.15.18 - Chatbot Updates

* Model selection will now be stored as a cookie to allow it to persist between sessions.
* Image handling has been updated to recover when switching between vision models and language models. A new `MAX_IMAGES` setting has been added to allow persisting more than one image in the same conversation context (must be supported by model or the images will be pruned by chatbot)
* Model selection option `/model list` will display list of available models in chat windows.

## 0.15.17 - Model Selector

* Chatbot - The `/model` command will now initiate a UI popup window and dropdown to allow the user to select a model from the list of available models. Alternatively, the user can specify the model with the command (e.g. `/model mixtral`) to select it immediately without the popup.

## 0.15.16 - Think Tags

* Chatbot - Add `/think filter` command and `THINK_FILTER` environmental setting to have chatbot filter out (no display) the \<think>\</think> content from models that have built in CoT reasoning like Deepseek R1.

## 0.15.15 - Docker Compose

* Quick Start using Docker compose for Chatbot.
* Chatbot - Bug Fix: Remove token limit on response. The `MAXTOKENS` setting is used to prune content sent to LLM. If not set, no pruning will happen.
* Chatbot - Added additional LiteLLM support with the environmental settings `LITELLM_PROXY` and `LITELLM_KEY`. If set, these will override the OpenAI API settings to use LiteLLM and will remove `EXTRA_BODY` defaults that conflict with LiteLLM.

## 0.15.14 - Multi-model Support

* Chatbot - Add `/model` command to list available models and dynamically set models during the session.

## 0.15.13 - Resource Fix

* Chatbot - Add LLM connection closures for non-streaming ad-hoc calls (e.g. CoT calls). This has removed the resource warning. Improved debug messages.
* Chatbot Documentation - Updated CoT prompts and added reasoning.md for additional prompt options.

## 0.15.12 - Update CoT

* Chatbot - Update Chain of Thought (CoT) to check request before routing all prompts through the CoT process. Using `/think always` will force CoT for all requests. Additionally, CoT prompts updated for better responses.

## 0.15.11 - Chain of Thought

* Chatbot - Add Chain of Thought (CoT) thinking option using the `/think on` or `/think off` toggles to the UI. When activated, queries will be passed through an out-of-band CoT loop to allow the LLM to thoughtfully explore answer and then provide a conclusion summary to the user. Set environmental variable "THINKING" to "true" to default all conversations to CoT mode.

## 0.15.10 - Bug Fix

* Chatbot - Fix error handling bug used to auto-detect max content length of LLM. Updated user input UI rendering to better handle indentation.

* Chatbot - Clean up logging: non-critical logs are moved to DEBUG level.

## 0.15.7 - Vision Model Support

* Chatbot - Allows user to drag and drop images into the context window for multi-modal vision LLMs.

## 0.15.6 - Progressive Loading

* Chatbot - Updated /rag commands to allow turning auto-RAG on and off, setting the collection and result number.
